# OpenACC Online Course - Lab 3

Welcome to the third and final lab of the OpenACC Online Course. In this lab you learn to further optimize the application we have been working on in the previous 2 labs. The lab uses a Jupyter notebook, like this one, and the PGI Compiler. If you are not familiar with Jupyter, you may execute the commands in a cell by pressing ctrl-enter or pressing the "Run" button at the top of the page. This lab is available in C or Fortran, please choose the version that best fits your needs below.
